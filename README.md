# ML-algorithm-acc-test
An academic project to test the performance of certain ML Algorithms. This report described a project 
aimed at using machine learning algorithms to fasten the process of identifying counterfeit banknotes 
from real banknotes. The system should be both fast and accurate to allow reliable results when dealing 
with large amounts of banknotes.
